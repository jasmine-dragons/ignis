# Ignis

## Inspiration
In recognition of National Fire Prevention Week, my team decided to tackle the theme of environmental sustainability with a platform to prepare communities for wildfires to reduce the damage and impact of these natural disasters.  As a team from California, one of the states that historically suffers the most from wildfires every Autumn, we have seen firsthand the havoc that wildfires can wreck, on both rural and urban communities alike.

## What it does
For our project, we utilized an interactive map interface to provide visualizations of curated wildfire information that we generated for each county in the United States. Fetching from our back-end and external APIs, we are able to display live and historical statistics of relevant weather information along with future machine-learning based predictions and tips to prepare communities in advance.

## How we built it
We build our project using a modern full-stack of cutting edge real industry technologies. Our frontend is build in React with a framework called Next.js to offer faster loading times and enrich user interactions along with TypeScript to develop a maintainable and structured codebase
